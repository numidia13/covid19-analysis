# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes COVID-19 cases globally, providing insights into the spread and impact of the virus based on the dataset obtained from Kaggle. The analysis includes data exploration, visualizations, and key trends, with the aim of understanding the patterns and dynamics of the pandemic.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on the analysis of COVID-19 cases, including confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, across various countries and regions. It also includes visualizations that highlight key statistics and trends over time. The dataset provides insights into the global pandemic situation, helping researchers, analysts, and the general public understand the ongoing crisis.

### Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insights into global COVID-19 trends and country-specific statistics.
- **Visualizations:** Graphs showing the number of cases, deaths, recoveries, fatality rates, and trends over time.
- **Time Series Analysis :** Exploring and forecasting COVID-19 cases over time (using models like ARIMA or Prophet).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the "Corona Virus Report" by imdevskp, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report). It includes data on:
- **Confirmed Cases:** The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide.
- **Deaths:** The number of deaths attributed to COVID-19.
- **Recovered:** The number of people who have recovered from COVID-19.
- **Active Cases:** The current number of active cases.
- **Country/Region:** The country or region where the cases have been reported.
- **Date:** The date when the data was recorded.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset file.
- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for detailed data analysis and visualization.
- **`src/`**: Contains Python scripts for any additional data processing or machine learning tasks.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
